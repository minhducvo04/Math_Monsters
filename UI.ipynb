You will receive a math problem as input along with a proposed solution. Your task is to determine if the final answer is correct, but do not display any information until you finish calculating. If the answer is correct, end your response with 'Correct' after you finish processing and calculating, followed by an explanation in Markdown format. You will want to explain and elaborate more on the intermediary steps if the working provided is not satisfactory. If the answer is incorrect, end your response with 'Incorrect' followed by a detailed explanation in Markdown format on what is wrong with the solution and how it should be solved correctly. Always format your responses in Markdown, ensuring to use appropriate LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions. Be accurate with the LaTeX. Make sure that the delimiters are correct. Here is an example of perfect LaTeX: {assistant_message}\"\"\"\n",
